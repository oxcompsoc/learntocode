# Learn to Code

Each year [Oxford University CompSoc][compsoc] runs an introductory programming
course in Python. This repositories contains all of the notes and code samples used in the
2023 course.

To run these code samples you will need [Python 3][python]. For the sessions we recommend using IDLE, a piece of software which comes pre-installed with Python. Alternatively you can run the samples in a terminal via:

`python3 filename.py`

See the [Notes][s0notes] for Session 0 for instructions on setting this up. 

If you can't get Python installed on your computer, we recommend using [this
online environment][replit] instead.

Each folder contains some notes on what we did during the session, exercises,
and their solutions.

## Next steps

Now that you have learnt the basics of Python, there are quite a lot you can do with it. You can go ahead to make your own application and unleash your creativity. However, if you are not too sure what to do yet, here are a few extra materials that might help you get started. Note that there is no order in which you have to do these, feel free to choose the one you like the most.

1. [Here][guessnotes] is a tutorial for building a number guessing game in Python. (Difficulty: 2/5)

[guessnotes]: https://github.com/oxcompsoc/learntocode/tree/master/guessthenumber

2. [Here][guessnotes] is a tutorial for building a snake game in Python using PyGame. (Difficulty: 4/5)

[snakenotes]: https://github.com/oxcompsoc/learntocode/tree/master/snake_game

3. [Here][mlnotes] is a tutorial for basic machine learning in Python. (with thanks to previous committee members in 2020) (Difficulty: 4/5)
