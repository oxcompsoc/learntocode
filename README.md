# Learn to Code

Each year [Oxford University CompSoc][compsoc] runs an introductory programming
course in Python. This repositories contains all of the notes and code samples used in the
2022 course.

To run these code samples you will need [Python 3][python]. For the sessions we recommend using IDLE, a piece of software which comes pre-installed with Python. Alternatively you can run the samples in a terminal via:

`python3 filename.py`

See the [Notes][s0notes] for Session 0 for instructions on setting this up. 

If you can't get Python installed on your computer, we recommend using [this
online environment][replit] instead.

Each folder contains some notes on what we did during the session, exercises,
and their solutions.
