# Snake Game with PyGame

We will use PyGame - a python game library - to create a simple snake game.

In order to do that, we will split the screen into 10x10 squares which might be occupied by either the snake or its food.
We will keep track of the body of the snake, the position of its food, and the direction its currently going in.
If the front of the snake reaches the food, the food will reappear and the snake will gain an extra square of body.

To create the game, you need to code some of the functions that are left blank.
Each of those functions has a TODO section which explains what that piece of code is supposed to do and some hints for the implementation.
If all of the functions are implemented, the code will open a window to a fully functioning snake game with adjustable difficulty and possibility for customization.
