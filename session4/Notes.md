# Session 4: Lists

Lists are an important part of a program. We would like to store a bunch of items in one variable.

## Basics

Suppose we wanted to create a shopping list app. We would like to be able to store our user's shopping list and retrieve the items from it on demand. 

This is where Python lists come in. Here is how we create a list:

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
```

In Python, we can also `print` the whole list, to view all the items:

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
print(shopping_list)
```

Or we can access the items one by one:

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
print(shopping_list[0]) # Prints 'bread'
print(shopping_list[1]) # Prints 'smoked salmon'
print(shopping_list[2]) # Prints 'cherry tomatoes'
print(shopping_list[3]) # Prints 'cream cheese'
```

As we can see, a list is an numbered collection of items. An important thing to remember is that in Python **indexing starts at 0**. What that means is that the first item is *at* **index** 0, the second item is at index 1, etc. We access the item at index `i` (where `i` is an integer) by writing `shopping_list[i]` - the name of the list, and then the index in square brackets. 

Now what would happen if we try to access the item at index 4 of our shopping list? Let's try:

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
print(shopping_list[4]) # ERROR: list index out of range 
```

If you run this code, you would get something called an index error. This is because there is no item at index 4. Note now, that the list has 4 items, but the highest index is 3. In general, a list with `n` items will have a highest index of `n-1`. 

We can get the *length* of the list (i.e. the number of items in it), by calling the `len` function:

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
length = len(shopping_list)
print("The length of the list is: " + str(length))
```

Note that the `len` function returns an `int`, so we need to convert that to a `str` before printing.


## Exercises

### Easy:
* 1: Create a list of 3 cities you want to visit. Print the whole list on one line. Print the list item by item. Print the length of the list.

### Medium:

* 2: Complete the program so that it prints the contents of the shopping list:

  ```python
  shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]

  i = 0
  length = len(shopping_list)
  while i < length:
    # Complete this code
  ```

### Hard:
* 3: Complete the program so that it prompts the user to input a number `n`, then prints `shopping_list`, item by item, `n` times in a row:
  
  ```python
  shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
  n = # Complete the rest of the program
  # ...
  ```
  A run of your program might look like:
  ```
  Please enter a number: 2
  bread
  smoked salmon
  cherry tomatoes
  cream cheese
  bread
  smoked salmon
  cherry tomatoes
  cream cheese
  ```

## The need for lists

We will discuss why we need lists in this section.

Imagine a world without lists. Then we have to use a different variable for each item in the shopping list, like this:

```python
shopping_list_item_1 = "bread"
shopping_list_item_2 = "smoked salmon"
shopping_list_item_3 = "cherry tomatoes"
shopping_list_item_4 = "cream cheese"
```

This is certainly annoying, what's more is that there is no effective way to manipulate all items using loops. For example, if we would like to print everything in the shopping list, this is the only thing we can do...

```python
print(shopping_list_item_1)
print(shopping_list_item_2)
print(shopping_list_item_3)
print(shopping_list_item_4)
```

However, with lists, we can store all items in one single variable in one single line.

```python
shopping_list = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese"]
```

And we can print the whole list at once using `print(shopping_list)`. List is certainly a good thing to have in our programming language.

## More list operations

We can append an element to a list - basically adding it to the end:

```python
# We forgot to add mayo to the list so we can add it later like so:
shopping_list.append("mayo") # shopping_list is now [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cheddar", "mayo" ]
```

Or remove an element from the list:

```python
del shopping_list[4] # shopping_list is now [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cheddar" ]
```

Alternatively, you can remove an element by value, so instead of the previous
line we could have written:

```python
shopping_list.remove("mayo")
```

Do note that this is more computationally expensive because the computer needs to go through the entire list to find the mayo, similarly to how you would go down a list from the start to find it.

You can also join two lists together:

```python
shopping_page1 = ["bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes"]
shopping_page2 = ["cheddar", "mayo" ]
shopping_list = shopping_page1 + shopping_page2 # shopping_list is now [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cheddar", "mayo" ]
```

**Note:** you may have seen what Python calls lists called *arrays* in other programming languages. In most programming languages [there is a difference][listvsarray] but it is not relevant to Python or this course.

## Exercises:

### Expert 
* 4: Make your own shopping list program! Begin by prompting a user to enter the number of things they want on their list and then ask them for each separate item. The program should output the items on the list in the same order, each on a separate line, after the user's done with their input.

  Here's a sample run:
  ```
  Welcome to the shopping list app!
  Please enter the size of your shopping list: 3
  Please enter item number 0: bread
  Please enter item number 1: smoked salmon
  Please enter item number 2: cherry tomatoes
  Your shopping list is:
  bread
  smoked salmon
  cherry tomatoes
  ```
  *Hint: the next few lines might be helpful:*

  ```python
  my_list = [] # This is how we create an empty list. I.e. a list with no items
  my_list.append("item1") # This is how we append to the back of our list
  my_list.append("item2") # And again
  print(my_list) # Prints '["item1", "item2"]'
  print(len(my_list)) # Prints '2'
  ```

* 5: Modify your program for slightly so that it displays the item number starting from 1 instead of 0.

  ```
  Welcome to the shopping list app!
  Please enter the size of your shopping list: 3
  Please enter item number 1: bread
  Please enter item number 2: smoked salmon
  Please enter item number 3: cherry tomatoes
  Your shopping list is:
  bread
  smoked salmon
  cherry tomatoes
  ```

* 6: Do you really need to enter the number n in the beginning? Wouldn't it be more convenient for a user to tell when the shopping list _ends_ instead? Make a program that does just that. Here's a sample run:

  ```
  Welcome to the shopping list app!
  Please enter item number 1: bread
  Please enter item number 2: smoked salmon
  Please enter item number 3: cherry tomatoes
  Please enter item number 4: end
  Your shopping list is:
  bread
  smoked salmon
  cherry tomatoes
  ```

## Recap on loops

While loops

```python
n = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
i = 1
while i < n:
    print(i)
    i += 1 # Increment i (i becomes bigger by 1).
```

For loops

```python
n = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, n): # including 1 excluding n
    print(i)
```

In general you write a `for` loop like so:
```python
for i in range(a, b):
    # including a excluding b
    # this block will repeat (b - a) times 
    # you will have access to the number of the current "repeat" with i
```

As you can see `for` loops take care of a lot of things for us - you don't have to define your own `i` and increment it yourself. On the other hand, that makes `for` loops less flexible - there are some cases where you might not want to have a counter or you might want to decrement it.

## Loops with lists

What loops are really useful for is *iterating* over lists. 

While loops
```python
shopping_list = [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese" ]
n = len(shopping_list)
i = 0
while i < n:
    print("I need to buy " + shopping_list[i])
    i += 1

# This will print out:
# I need to buy bread
# I need to buy smoked salmon
# I need to buy cherry tomatoes
# I need to buy cream cheese
```

For loops

```python
shopping_list = [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese" ]
n = len(shopping_list)
for i in range(0, n):
    print("I need to buy " + shopping_list[i])

# This will print out:
# I need to buy bread
# I need to buy smoked salmon
# I need to buy cherry tomatoes
# I need to buy cream cheese
```

## A further simplication

In fact, we can further simplify that `for` loop, so that we don't need the variables `n` and `i` anymore.

```python
shopping_list = [ "bread", "smoked salmon", "cherry tomatoes", "cream cheese" ]
for item in shopping_list:
    print("I need to buy " + item)

# This will print out:
# I need to buy bread
# I need to buy smoked salmon
# I need to buy cherry tomatoes
# I need to buy cream cheese
```

<!-- This gives us an insight as to what `range(a, b)` does - it's a function (we'll get to what that means later) that is equivalent to writing `[a, a + 1, a + 2, ..., b - 2, b - 1]` so we were iterating over lists all along. -->

## Exercises

We will do the exercises listed in the `session5` folder. We have not covered functions yet, but you can still do the exercises. For example, if you would like to do exercise 1, you can copy the code in `session5/exercise1.py` to your local machine. Then write your code in the `def` clause. 

For example,

```python
def sum(xs):
    # return the sum of all the elements in the list xs
    # remove the following line
    print("Write your code here!!!!!!!")
    return 0

def test(test_case, expected):
    actual = sum(test_case)
    if actual == expected:
        print("Passed test for " + str(test_case))
    else:
        print("Didn't pass test for " + str(test_case))
        print("The result was " + str(actual) + " but it should have been " + str(expected))

test([], 0)
test([1, 2], 3)
test(range(10), 45)
```

Then when you run your code using Python, it will run some tests on your code automatically, and tell you whether your code is correct.

<!-- What we'll do next is finish up the exercises from last session. You can find them [here](https://github.com/oxcompsoc/learntocode/tree/master/session2#Exercises-1). If you've already completed the exercises then try to replace your uses of `while` with equivalent `for` loops. There are some exercises where that is impossible which will give you a good idea of the limitations of `for`. -->
