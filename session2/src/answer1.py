# You can check that the inputted number is 1 like this
number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
if number == 1:
    print("The number is 1.")
else:
    print("The number is not 1.")

# or you can directly check that the inputted string is "1" like this
number = input("Please enter a number: ")
if number == "1":
    print("The number is 1.")
else:
    print("The number is not 1.")
# of course, this second approach is cheating. :)
